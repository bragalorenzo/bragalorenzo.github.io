    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
      This is my personal website hosted on GitHub Pages.  
      Here I share research notes, analyses, and projects related to palaeoecology, palynology, 
      and quantitative approaches to environmental reconstruction.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am particularly interested in plant biodiversity of the past and its reconstruction, especially in wetlands, numerical ecology methods and informatic tools applied to palaeoenvironmental research.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I am enrolled at the last year of the PhD program in Models and Methods for Material and Environmental Sciences. 
      I am carrying out my research activities at the Laboratory of Palinology and Palaeobotany of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy.
      I am a member of the BRAIN - Botanical Records of Archaeobotany Italian Network, of the Thematic Working Group on Plant Biodiversity of the Past (TWG-PBP) of the Italian Botanical Society (SBI), and of the PalaeOpen COST Action.
